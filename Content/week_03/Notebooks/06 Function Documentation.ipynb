    "In programming, the functionality of your code is only as valuable as the ability of others (and yourself) to understand and use it effectively. Documenting functions plays a pivotal role in ensuring that your code can be read, understood, and maintained over time. Here are several key reasons why function documentation should not be an afterthought:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Readability:**\n",
    "    - The primary goal of function documentation is to enhance the readability of your code. When a developer encounters a function, the documentation should immediately convey the function's purpose without the need to decipher the code itself. Well-documented functions allow developers to grasp the logic quickly, saving time and reducing cognitive load.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maintenance:**\n",
    "    - Code maintenance is a significant part of the software development lifecycle. Over the course of a project, code is modified, refactored, and extended. Documentation acts as a guidepost for future maintainers, providing them with the necessary context to make changes confidently. When the original author of the code is no longer available, good documentation is often the only source of insight into the design decisions that were made.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Onboarding:**\n",
    "    - When new developers join a project, they often face a steep learning curve. Comprehensive function documentation can significantly ease this process, allowing newcomers to get up to speed more quickly. Instead of relying solely on direct communication with the existing team, new developers can rely on documentation to understand how to use various parts of the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collaboration:**\n",
    "    - In team environments, where multiple developers work on the same codebase, clear documentation is critical for collaboration. It helps in aligning understanding and ensures that everyone is on the same page regarding how functions are supposed to work, what inputs they expect, and what outputs they produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Debugging:**\n",
    "    - When something goes wrong, well-documented functions can be a lifesaver. Debugging involves tracing through the code to find where things are breaking. Documentation can provide immediate hints about what a function was intended to do, which can be compared against its actual behavior to identify bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusability:**\n",
    "    - Software development often involves building on existing solutions. When functions are well-documented, they can be more easily reused in different parts of the application, or even in different projects, because their functionality is clearly described and their interfaces are well-defined.\n"

    "With the introduction of Python 3.5, a new feature called *type hinting* was added to the Python language. Type hints provide a way to explicitly state the expected data types of function arguments and the return type. These hints are not enforced at runtime, meaning Python remains a dynamically typed language, but they can be used by static type checkers, IDEs, linters, and documentation generators to ensure that the types are correct and consistent. Type hints complement documentation by providing a clear and concise way to indicate the types of variables, which helps developers understand the code more quickly and can catch type-related errors early in the development process.\n"
