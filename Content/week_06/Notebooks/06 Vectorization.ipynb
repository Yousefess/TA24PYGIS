    "6. **Profile and optimize**: When working with large datasets or complex operations, profile your code to identify performance bottlenecks. Use profiling tools like `%timeit` in Jupyter Notebook or `cProfile` to measure the execution time of different parts of your code and optimize accordingly.\n",

    "Vectorization is not always the best approach for every problem. Here are some situations where vectorization may not be suitable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complex or non-vectorizable operations**: Some operations or algorithms may not be easily expressible using NumPy's vectorized operations. If your problem involves complex logic, multiple conditions, or sequential dependencies, vectorization may not be straightforward or even possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Small datasets**: If you are working with small datasets or arrays, the overhead of vectorization may outweigh its benefits. In such cases, using explicit loops or other approaches may be more efficient.\n",

If your data involves non-numeric types, such as strings or custom objects, vectorization may not be directly applicable. NumPy does provide some limited support for vectorized string operations, but it may not be as extensive as numeric operations.\n",

If the vectorized code becomes too complex or difficult to understand, it may be better to opt for a more explicit and readable implementation, even if it involves loops.\n",
